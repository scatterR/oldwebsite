excerpt: 'The question of whether and how mutual fund managers provide valuable services
for their clients motivates one of the largest literatures in finance. One candidate explanation
is that funds process information about future asset values and use that information
to invest in high-valued assets. But formal theories are scarce because information
choice models with many assets are difficult to solve as well as difficult to test. This paper
tackles both problems by developing a new attention allocation model that uses the
state of the business cycle to predict information choices, which in turn, predict observable
patterns of portfolio investments and returns. The predictions about fund portfolios’
covariance with payoff shocks, cross-fund portfolio and return dispersion, and
their excess returns are all supported by the data. These findings offer new evidence
that some investment managers have skill and that attention is allocated rationally.'
