Abstract: This paper investigates volume dynamics in the financial market around macroeconomic
announcements. Volumes in the stock market are abnormally low in anticipation of FOMC
announcements compared to their past monthly trend. In the cross section, assets with
higher systematic risks exhibit greater volume changes. This negative pre-announcement
risk-volume relation is reversed after announcements. I attribute the cross-sectional relation
between volume and systematic risk to a theory where macroeconomic news resolves
information asymmetries. Consistent with this explanation, I find price impact increases in
anticipation of FOMC announcements and decreases afterwards, especially for assets with
high systematic risks. I find little evidence that volume declines in anticipation of other
types of macroeconomic announcements.
